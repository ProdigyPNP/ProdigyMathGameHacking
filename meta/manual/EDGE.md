## How to hack Prodigy: Microsoft Edge (Manual Install)

<br>

### WARNING: Sorry, but PHEx currently doesn't work on Edge through manual installation.
### [You can still use PHEX in Edge through the Edge addons store](../webstores/EDGE.md).


<br>

1. Open **Edge**.
2. In Edge, enter ``about:flags`` in the URL bar.
3. Under **Developer settings**, find `Enable extension developer features (this might put your device at risk)`.
4. Restart Edge (closing and opening the browser should be enough).
5. [Download PHEx.zip](https://github.com/ProdigyPNP/ProdigyMathGameHacking/releases/latest)
6. In your downloads folder, you should find a file that says `x.x.x-PHEx.zip`. **Unzip that file**.
7. Click on the edge options menu (the three dots under the X).
8. In the options menu, click on **Extensions**.
9. In Extensions, click **Load extension**.
10. Select `x.x.x-PHEx` from your downloads folder.
11. You should see a new extension called `Prodigy Hacking Extension | PHEx` in your extensions.
12. Go to [Prodigy](https://play.prodigygame.com) (``play.prodigygame.com``).
13. Log in as usual to Prodigy. REMEMBER THAT WE STILL RECCOMMEND YOU TO LOG IN WITH A SECOND ACCOUNT TO PREVENT ACCEDENTALLY CORRUPTING YOUR MAIN ACCOUNT.
14. Once you enter a world, wait 5-15 seconds.
15. In the top left corner of your screen, you should see a dropdown arrow. Click the dropdown arrow to open the hacks.
16. Congrats, you've successfully achived hacking in the Prodigy Math Game.
