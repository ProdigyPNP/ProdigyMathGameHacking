## How to install

1.) Install the [extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/prodigyhacking/gjabpajagbgoifbkflgojeojmnlmioea) (also known as PHEx) from the Chrome Web Store.
<br/>
2.) Visit https://prodigygame.com
<br/>
3.) <b>Make a second account</b> and log in. DO NOT USE HACKS ON YOUR PRIMARY ACCOUNT. Hacks can damage your account if used improperly or excessively, and most hacks can't be undone.
<br/>
4.) A dropdown arrow will appear after 15-20 seconds.

## Motivation

<details>
<summary><b>We aren't evil. Everything is open source, forever free, and without ads.</b></summary>
<br>
We're not trying to break the game because we're evil. We wanted to help Prodigy become more secure, but they've ignored our emails and our requests to talk. They've even gone as far as to ban a user from their official Zendesk.

Because of that, we're publicly showing hacks! That, and it's also just fun :)

All of our hacks are open source, and free. No paywalls, no ads, and no Patreon. If you really want to support us, you can Nitro boost our Discord server [here](https://discord.gg/XQDfbfq)!
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can you hack for me?</b></summary>

No. See [#170](https://github.com/Prodigy-Hacking/ProdigyMathGameHacking/discussions/170).

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How do I know you won't steal my account?</b></summary>
Of course, with trusting any hacks, comes the risk that we're actually bad actors that will steal all your info.
It's impossible to prove with absolute certainty to anyone reading this that we aren't bad faith, but we can open source our things, and try to be transparent.

- We do not want your account.

Not only do we not want your account, but we will actively ban you from our organization if you share your credentials online. It's bad security, and we really can't be bothered.

- But what if you steal my personal info?

We do not want your personal info. Please do not share it. Even if we wanted to, there's not much we could do with it. "Wow, John Doe is in 5th grade and has mastered fractions!"

- How do I know what code is running in the hacks?

Again, our code is open source, and you're always free to read any of it. If you have trouble understanding what a certain thing does, feel free to ask any of the administrators on our official Discord.

## Disclaimer

<details>
<summary><b>Always use an alt, just to be safe.</b></summary>
<br>
While our hacks are completely safe, <strong>you should never use hacks on your main account</strong>.

There's an <b>extremely small</b> chance your account will be hacker-tagged, reset, or <b>banned</b>. Luckily, it almost never happens. The only incidents PMGH knows of users being banned for hacking were contributors or staff of PMGH itself.

We will <b>never<b/> ask you for your password. If somebody asks you for personal/sensitive information, report it to the staff on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/XQDfbfq).

All of our hacks are *open-source*, and only located under our [Github Organization](https://github.com/Prodigy-Hacking).
*If it's not an official repository or a fork, it may not be safe!*

<details>
<summary><b>We're not liable for damage to your account.</b></summary>
<br>
- All hacks, exploits, or other files hosted here may damage your account if used improperly or excessively. We can't stress enough, do not use <i>any</i> of these hacks on your primary account, as you risk your account becoming damaged beyond repair, preventing you from accessing Prodigy Math Game in that account. You have been warned.
<br>
- We are not liable for any damages of any kind, as our license states:

> Limitation of Liability
> Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.
